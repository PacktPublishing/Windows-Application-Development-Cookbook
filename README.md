This book presents development of UWP applications for various devices running on the Windows 10 operating system. Thus, you need a set of tools that allow designing the user interface, writing supporting code, as well as running the application and testing it. Fortunately, all of these features are available in the Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015, which you can use while reading this book. The process of its installation and configuration is presented in detail in Chapter 1, Getting Started. 
To step through all recipes presented in this book, especially to publish an application in the Windows Store, it is necessary to have a developer account. What is more, it is recommended to have a real smartphone or tablet with the Windows 10 operating system to test the developed applications on a real device. If you do not have one, you can use the built-in emulators, but not all recipes can be checked in practice.
